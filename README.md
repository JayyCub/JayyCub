# *Hello!*

I'm Jacob, an early-career software engineer. 

My project and work experience center around web and mobile app development. I excel in React, Vue, and plain HTML/CSS front-end development. For back-end development, I enjoy Node.js and AWS/GCP-powered solutions. My flagship project is a React Native app that provides users with live theme park wait times and tools like favorite lists and, soon, customized push notifications about ride wait time thresholds and reopenings.
